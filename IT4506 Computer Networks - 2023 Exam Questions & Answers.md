# IT4506 Computer Networks - 2023 Exam Questions & Answers

## Part 1: Multiple Choice Questions

Here are a few representative MCQs and their answers from the 2023 paper:

---
**Question:** What is the name of the Protocol Data Unit (PDU) used in the Transport layer in the OSI model?
(a) Frame
(b) Bit
(c) Packet
(d) SPDU
(e) Segment
**Answer:** (e) Segment

---
**Question:** In the OSI model, which layer is responsible for ensuring process to process data delivery?
(a) Network Layer
(b) Transport Layer
(c) Physical Layer
(d) Datalink Layer
(e) Internet Layer
**Answer:** (b) Transport Layer

---
**Question:** What is the size of the fixed header of Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) Protocol Data Unit (PDU)?
(a) 1 bytes
(b) 10 bytes
(c) 20 bytes
(d) 40 bytes
(e) 512 bytes
**Answer:** (c) 20 bytes

**Question:** Which DNS resource record type specifies the servers responsible for receiving emails for a particular domain?
(a) SOA
(b) AAAA
(c) MX
(d) TXT
(e) SPF
**Answer:** (c) MX

**Question:** Which component of the Software Defined Networks (SDN) architecture facilitates the programming of the network behaviour through the controller?
(a) Data Plane
(b) SDN Applications
(c) Network Operating System
(d) Southbound API
(e) Northbound API
**Answer:** The provided answer key suggests "(d)" or "(e)" could be considered correct. The **Northbound API** allows applications to program behavior through the controller, while the **Southbound API** allows the controller to program the devices. Given the phrasing "programming of the network behaviour *through* the controller," the **Northbound API (e)** is arguably more directly related to how external entities program behavior via the controller itself.

**Question (based on diagram):** What is the Datalink layer protocol that can be used between PC0 and SW1?
(a) UDP
(b) IEEE 802.11
(c) TCP
(d) IP
(e) Ethernet
**Answer:** (e) Ethernet (PC0 is connected via a cable to SW1, implying Ethernet).

---
**Question (based on diagram):** What is the transport layer protocol used by PC0 when requesting the website from the Web server?
(a) HTTP
(b) TCP
(c) UDP
(d) FTP
(e) ARP
**Answer:** (b) TCP (HTTP, which is used for websites, runs on top of TCP).

**Question:** A machine in a network (L) uses the IP address 8.8.8.8/25. What is the subnet mask used in this network in dotted decimal notation?
(a) 255.255.255.128
(b) 255.255.255.0
(c) 255.255.255.1
(d) 1.255.255.255
(e) 255.255.255.25
**Answer:** (a) 255.255.255.128 (A /25 prefix means the first 25 bits are for the network, leaving 7 bits for hosts. The 25th bit in the last octet is the 128 bit).

## Part 2: Structured Questions

Here's a selection from the 2023 structured questions:

### Question 1 (based on diagram):
An IP datagram P is sent from machine A to machine C. P is encapsulated in the link layer frame F1 in LAN 1 and in F2 in LAN 2. A user X is logged in as the administrator of machine C and can observe all link layer frames coming to C. LAN 1 and LAN 2 use Ethernet.

**(a). Question:** Is it possible for X to determine the MAC address of the interface of A by analysing F2? Justify your answer.
**Answer:** No. P comes to C encapsulated in a link layer frame generated by B. Therefore, X can only discover the MAC address of one interface of B. No link layer frame in LAN 1 reaches C.

**(b). Question:** Is it possible for X to discover the subnet mask used in LAN 2, based only on the information available in F2? Justify your answer.
**Answer:** No. Subnet mask is not carried in an IP datagram. It is not a field in the IP header.

**(e). Question:** Describe the use of the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) at B when forwarding P to the machine C?
**Answer:** P contains the destination IP (of C). B (Router) needs to find the MAC address corresponding to this IP address (C's IP) to encapsulate P in the link layer frame F2 for transmission on LAN 2. B uses ARP to resolve C's IP address to C's MAC address on LAN 2.

### Question 2:

**(a). Question:** Preamble is the first component in the Ethernet header. Describe the content of the Preamble and the purpose of it.
**Answer:** The Preamble consists of 8 bytes. The first 7 bytes have the bit pattern `10101010`. The last byte (Start of Frame Delimiter - SFD) is `10101011`. The purpose of the preamble is to allow the receiving system's physical layer circuitry to synchronize its clock with the incoming data stream before the actual frame data begins.

**(d). Question:** User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a popular transport layer protocol. List down the four (4) fields in the UDP header.
**Answer:** The four fields in the UDP header are:
* Source Port
* Destination Port
* UDP Length
* UDP Checksum

**(e). Question:** Describe the steps of Remote Procedure Call (RPC) between two machines using a suitable diagram.
**Answer:** The steps are:
1.  Client calls the client stub (a local procedure call).
2.  The client stub packs (marshals) the parameters into a message and makes a system call to send the message.
3.  The client's operating system sends the message to the server machine over the network.
4.  The server's operating system passes the incoming packet to the server stub.
5.  The server stub unpacks (unmarshals) the parameters and calls the actual server procedure with these parameters.
The reply from the server procedure follows a similar path back to the client.
(The answer in the PDF also mentions a diagram is required, similar to the one in Topic 5 - Page 20 or provided in the answer script).
