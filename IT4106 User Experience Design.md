2.  **HCI as a forerunner to UX design**
3.  *"User Experience Design"* often used interchangeably but distinct from *"User Interface Design"* and *"Usability"*
4.  **Usability and UI as important subsets of UX design**
5.  **Definition of User Experience (UX):**
    -   Encompasses all aspects of the end-user's interaction with a company, its services, and products
    -   Focus on deep understanding of users (needs, values, abilities, limitations)
    -   Consideration of business goals and objectives
    -   UX best practices for improving interaction quality and perception
6.  **Don Norman's definition of User Experience:** A cohesive, integrated set of experiences across all stages of a product/service
7.  **UI Design vs. UX Design:**
    -   UI: Focus on screens, pages, visual elements (buttons, icons) for interaction
    -   UX: Focus on the internal experience during interaction with all company aspects
8.  **Analogy:** UI as the aesthetics, UX as the underlying structure and problem-solving
    > "A UI without UX is like a painter slapping paint onto a canvas without thought, while UX without UI is like the frame of a sculpture with no paper mache on it."
9.  **Work of a UX Engineer:** Considers the "Why, What, and How" of product use
    -   Diverse backgrounds (visual design, programming, psychology, interaction design)
    -   Involves user research, persona creation, wireframing, prototyping, testing

3.  **Specific Cognitive Processes:**
    -   **Attention:** Focusing on specific stimuli, selecting information. Depends on clear goals and information presentation. (Examples of good/bad info presentation)
    -   **Perception:** Acquiring information via senses and transforming it into experiences. Aided by grouping and spacing. (Example of web page link organization)
    -   **Memory:** Recalling knowledge to act appropriately. Involves filtering and encoding; context-dependent. Better at recognition than recall.
    -   **Learning:** Connected with memory.
        -   Incidental learning: Without intention (e.g., recognizing faces)
        -   Intentional learning: Goal-directed (e.g., studying for an exam)

    -   Mental Model (user's thought process) vs. Conceptual Model (actual model via interface)
5.  **Bridging Mental and Conceptual Models:**
    -   Making interfaces transparent (clear instructions, help, affordances)
    -   Anchoring conceptual model in user experience (research, familiar terminology, existing patterns, testing)
    -   Introducing new conceptual models gradually, relating to familiar concepts, using perceived affordances, educating users
    > Quote by Robert Greene on managing innovation and change
6.  **Gulfs of Execution and Evaluation:**
    -   Gaps between user and interface
    -   **Gulf of Execution:** Distance from user to physical system (How do I use this system?)

7.  **Example:** Wearable glucose monitor for diabetes (illustrating functional, data, environmental, user characteristics, usability, and UX goals)

## 5.3 Data Gathering Overview
1.  **Central to discovering requirements and evaluation**
2.  **Conducted to collect sufficient, accurate, relevant data for design**
3.  **In evaluation:** Captures user reactions and performance
4.  **Techniques require little to no programming/technical skills**
5.  **Three main techniques:** Interviews, Questionnaires, Observation

## 5.4 Issues in Data Gathering
1.  **Five key issues for successful data gathering:**
    -   **Goal Setting:** Glean information about users, behavior, or reactions; set specific study goals
    -   **Identifying Participants:** Goals indicate types of people (population/study population). Choosing participants is sampling.
        -   Probability Sampling (Random, Systematic, Stratified, Cluster)
        -   Non-Probability Sampling (Convenience, Snowball, Purposive/Judgement)
    -   **Relationship between Data Collector and Provider:** Important aspect. Achieved by informed consent (Example consent form elements)
    -   **Triangulation:** Using multiple sources/perspectives.
        -   Data Triangulation: Different sources, times, places, people, sampling techniques
        -   Investigator Triangulation: Different researchers involved in collection/interpretation
        -   Theory Triangulation: Different theoretical frameworks for viewing data
        -   Methodological Triangulation: Different data gathering techniques
    -   **Pilot Studies:** Small trial run of the main study to check method viability, equipment, instructions, questions

## 5.5 Recording Data
1.  **Approach depends on study goal, data use, context, time, resources, sensitivity**
2.  **Common approaches:** Note-taking, photographs, video/audio recording

## 5.6 Data Gathering Techniques

### 5.6.1 Interviews
-   Conversation with a purpose
-   **Types:** Open-ended/Unstructured, Structured, Semi-structured, Group interviews
-   Choice depends on purpose, questions, interaction design activity
-   **Unstructured:** Exploratory, like conversations, interviewee free to answer, can be steered by both (e.g., "Pros and cons of a wearable?")
-   **Structured:** Predetermined questions, standardized, short/clear questions, typically closed
-   **Semi-structured:** Combines structured/unstructured, uses closed/open questions, basic script, probes for more info

### 5.6.2 Focus Groups
-   Interviewing people in groups
-   Participants are a representative sample of the target population
-   Identifies conflicts in expectations/terminology
-   Allows diverse/sensitive issues to be raised

### 5.6.3 Questionnaires
-   Collect demographic data and user opinions
-   Closed or open-ended questions
-   Requires effort for clear wording and efficient data analysis
-   Can be online for remote participants

### 5.6.4 Observations
-   Direct (by investigator) or indirect (through activity records)
-   Helps understand users' context, tasks, goals
-   In natural setting (day-to-day tasks) or controlled environment (specified tasks)
-   **Degree of participation:** Passive observer (outsider)
    -   Participant observer (insider)
-   **Planning and conducting observation in the field:**
    -   Use frameworks (simple: person, place, thing; complex: space, actors, activities, objects, acts, events, time, goals, feelings)
    -   Focus on: level of participation, data recording, gaining acceptance, handling sensitive issues, ensuring diverse perspectives
-   **Ethnography:**
    -   Uncovers organization of societies/activities
    -   Aims to understand what people do and how they organize action/interaction
    -   Largely direct observation; observer adopts participant role
-   **Direct Observation in Controlled Environments:**
    -   In usability labs; more formal
    -   Prepare a script for consistency (greeting, goals, duration, rights)
    -   Think-aloud technique: Users say everything they are thinking/trying to do
-   **Indirect Observation: Tracking Users' Activities:**
    -   When direct observation is not possible (intrusive, duration)
    -   **Diaries:** Participants write about activities regularly (what, when, hard/easy, reactions). Useful for scattered/unreachable participants or private activities. Relies on participant reliability; incentives may be needed; memory issues.
    -   **Interaction Logs, Web Analytics, Data Scraping:** Software records user activity (keystrokes, mouse movements, time on page/help, task flow). Large data volumes, ethical concerns.
-   *(Comparison Table of Techniques is mentioned here: Good for, Kind of data, Advantages, Disadvantages for various techniques)*

## 5.7 Data Gathering for Requirements

### 5.7.1 Engaging Users with Probes
-   Designed to prompt participant interaction for researchers to learn about users/contexts
-   Rely on logging (automatic for technology probes, manual for diaries/design probes)
-   **Cultural Probes (Gaver et al., 1999):** Variation of diary study; wallet with postcards, maps, camera, photo album, media diary; recipients answer questions and return items
-   **Other Probe Types:**
    -   **Design Probes:** Objects relating to specific questions/contexts (e.g., Top Trumps probe)
    -   **Technology Probes:** Toolkits (SenseBoard for IoT), devices (M-Kulinda for movement monitoring)
    -   **Provocative Probes:** Challenge norms/attitudes to provoke discussion (e.g., "The Box" for laundry practices)

### 5.7.2 Contextual Inquiry
-   Core field research for Contextual Design (Holtzblatt and Beyer, 2017)
-   One-on-one field interviews (contextual interviews) on daily life relevant to project scope
-   Shifts power relationship: User as "Master" (does work while talking), interviewer as "Apprentice" (learns by observing)

### 5.7.3 Brainstorming
-   Generic technique to generate, refine, develop ideas
-   Widely used for alternative designs or new ideas
-   **Suggestions for successful brainstorming:** Diverse participants, allow silly ideas, use catalysts, keep records, sharpen focus, use warm-ups, make it fun

## 5.8 Augmenting Requirements
1.  **User stories may not fully communicate product purpose/vision**
2.  **Augment with prototypes, systems, screenshots, conversations, acceptance criteria, diagrams**
3.  **Common UXD techniques (similar to UML):** Personas, Scenarios

### 5.8.1 Personas (Cooper, 1999)
-   Rich descriptions of typical users for designers to focus on
-   Created from user research to represent different user types
-   Helps understand user needs, experiences, behaviors, goals
    > Alan Cooper: "Personas are the single most powerful design tool..."
-   **Guidelines for Creating Effective Personas:** Collect data, determine user qualities/differences, develop hypothesis, stakeholder agreement, determine number of personas (focus on one), name/describe (picture, values, interests, lifestyle, needs, goals, story), describe situations/scenarios, involve project team, ensure persona use, make continuous adjustments
-   **Example Personas:** "Rebecca" (Casual audiophile for Spotify); "Will" (Family traveler) & "Sky" (Young traveler) for group travel organizer

### 5.8.2 Scenarios
-   Informal narrative description (Carroll, 2000) of human activities/tasks
-   Allows exploration/discussion of contexts, needs, requirements
-   Not necessarily describing software/technology use
-   Uses user vocabulary, allowing stakeholder participation
-   **Example Scenario:** Thomson family planning a sailing trip (incorporates personas Will & Sky). Translates into requirements/user stories.
-   Can be textual, audio, video, or animations (e.g., animated scenarios for emergency alarm tech for elderly)

# Chapter 6: Data Analysis and Interpretation
*(Based on Teachers note_Section 06.pdf)*

## 6.1 Introduction to Data Analysis
1.  **Goal:** Introduce methods for data analysis and presentation
2.  **Influenced by goals and data gathered**
3.  **Types:** Qualitative, quantitative, mixed
4.  **Begins with initial reactions;** identifying patterns, calculating values (averages, percentages)
5.  **Data cleansing:** Look for anomalies (e.g., age 999)
6.  **Interpretation in parallel with analysis**
7.  **Common mistakes:**
    -   Investigator bias influencing interpretation (Example: Colombo vs. Jaffna office customer care processing times and varied interpretations)
    -   Making claims beyond data support
8.  **Presentation method depends on goals and target users**

## 6.2 Quantitative vs. Qualitative Data
1.  **Quantitative Data:** Numbers or easily translatable to numbers
2.  **Qualitative Data:** Words, images, descriptions, quotes, vignettes, photos
3.  **Quantitative Analysis:** Uses numerical methods for magnitude, amount, size. Representations: Bar graphs, pie charts, scatter plots.
4.  **Qualitative Analysis:** Focuses on nature, represented by themes, patterns, stories. (Example: Quantitative "avg person is 5'11", 180lbs, 45yo" vs. Qualitative "avg person is tall, thin, middle-aged")
5.  **Challenging false assumptions:** Observation isn't only qualitative, questionnaires aren't only quantitative.
    *(Table showing quantitative/qualitative data from observation/questionnaires is mentioned here)*
6.  **Qualitative data can be converted to numbers** (e.g., counting words in interviews), but meaningfulness must be assessed

## 6.3 Initial Steps in Data Analysis
1.  **Initial processing required:** Transcription of audio, data entry into spreadsheets
2.  *(Table of raw data, example qualitative/quantitative data, and initial processing steps for Interviews, Questionnaires, Observation is mentioned here)*

## 6.4 Qualitative Analysis
1.  **Three basic approaches:**
    -   Identifying themes (Inductive Analysis)
    -   Categorizing data (Deductive Analysis)
    -   Analyzing critical incidents
2.  **Often iterative;** themes identified inductively can be applied deductively
3.  **First step:** Overall impression, look for interesting features, repeated observations (depends on what's observed, e.g., turn-taking in collaborative learning tool use)
4.  **Second step:** Systematic search for themes, checking consistency

### 6.4.1 Identifying Themes - Thematic Analysis
-   Umbrella term for examining qualitative data
-   Identifies, analyzes, reports patterns (themes) in data
-   **Theme:** Pattern related to study goals (e.g., website info sufficiency - main theme: course dates needed; minor theme: logo distracting)
-   Look for overall narrative once themes identified
-   Often group-applied using brainstorming with sticky notes
-   **Affinity Diagram:** Method to gather and organize large data into groups/themes based on relationships. Also called "Space Saturate and Group".
-   **Creating Affinity Diagrams Steps:** Wall with post-its, group similar ideas, cluster groups, rank clusters, create connections, synthesize (insights, user needs, pain points, gaps), focus on translating to practice

### 6.4.2 Categorizing Data
-   Transcribe recorded data before analysis
-   Use results to answer study goals after categorization
-   Example: Transcript of think-aloud protocol
-   Example: Categorization scheme for usability problems (Interface Problems, Content Problems with sub-categories)
-   Example: Coding the transcript using the scheme

### 6.4.3 Critical Incident Analysis
-   Identifies significant subsets of data for detailed analysis
-   Focus on specific significant incidents, analyze in detail using rest of data as context
-   Example: User getting stuck in a usability test

## 6.5 Analytic Frameworks
1.  **Help analyze and interpret qualitative study data**
2.  **Six approaches:**
    -   **Conversation Analysis (CA):** Examines semantics of conversation in fine detail (how conversations start, turn-taking). Used in sociological studies; influenced understanding of user needs; compares conversations across media.
    -   **Discourse Analysis:** Focuses on dialogue, meaning of words, how words convey meaning. Strongly interpretive, context-attentive; language as social reality open to interpretation.
    -   **Content Analysis:** Classifying data into themes/categories, studying frequency of occurrences. Applicable to any "text" (video, newspapers, ads, images, sounds).
    -   **Interaction Analysis:** Investigates human interactions with each other and objects. Inductive process; focuses on talk and nonverbal interactions with artifacts/technologies (based on video recordings). Goal: Derive generalizations from naturally occurring activities.
    -   **Grounded Theory:** Develops theory from systematic analysis/interpretation of empirical data (theory is "grounded" in data). Inductive approach; alternating data collection and analysis; data categorization as "coding" (open, axial, selective).
    -   **Systems-Based Frameworks:** For understanding whole socio-technical systems at scale. Examples: Socio-technical systems theory, Distributed Cognition of Teamwork.
3.  *(Overview Table is mentioned here: Framework, Data, Focus, Expected Outcomes, Level of Granularity for each approach)*

## 6.6 Analyzing Requirements with Personas and Scenarios
*(Briefly mentioned, detailed in Chapter 5)*
-   Personas
-   Scenarios

## 6.7 Interpreting and Presenting Findings
1.  **Three presentation styles for meaningful interpretation and presentation:**
    -   **Using Structured Notations:** (e.g., UML, work models in contextual design)
        -   Advantage: Well-defined symbols, clear guidance, enforces precision
        -   Disadvantage: De-emphasizes other aspects, precision lost if audience unfamiliar with notation
        -   Usually combined with stories or other formats
    -   **Using Stories (Narratives/Scenarios):** Easy, intuitive way to communicate ideas/experiences
        -   Three ways: Participants' own stories during data gathering; narratives from observation for further data gathering; stories constructed from data snippets/episodes
    -   **Summarizing the Findings:** Combination of presentation styles (e.g., story with graphical representations, data excerpts)
        -   Numerical data as graphs, diagrams, rigorous notations with workflows/quotations

# Chapter 7: Designing Prototypes and Construction
*(Based on Teachers note_Section 07.pdf)*

## 7.1 Introduction to Prototyping
1.  **Goal:** Progress requirements through prototyping and construction cycles
2.  **Falls within "Develop" phase of Double Diamond** (concepts created, prototyped, tested, iterated)
3.  **Two aspects to design:** Conceptual Design, Concrete Design
4.  **Prototypes used to evaluate design**
5.  **Prototyping Definition:** Allows designers to communicate ideas, users to try them out. Stakeholders interact to explore suitability.
    > "Users can't tell you what they want, but...they soon know what they don't want."
6.  **Forms of Prototypes:** Scale models, software (buggy), paper-based outlines, wire collections, digital pictures, video simulations, complex software/hardware, 3D mockups (anything from paper storyboard to complex software) (Example: PalmPilot wooden prototype)
7.  **Why Prototype?**
    -   Answer questions, support choosing between alternatives
    -   Test technical feasibility, clarify vague requirements, user testing/evaluation, check design compatibility
8.  **Purpose influences prototype type** (e.g., paper mockup for task clarification) (Example: paper prototype for autistic child support device)
9.  **Fidelity of Prototypes:** How it conveys look-and-feel of final product; level of detail/functionality
    -   Range: Low Fidelity to High Fidelity (Example: Padlock prototypes from cardboard to CNC aluminum)
10. **Low-Fidelity Prototyping:**
    -   Doesn't look much like final product, different materials (paper/cardboard vs. electronic/metal), limited functions
    -   Useful: Simple, cheap, quick to produce
    -   **Storyboards:** Low-fidelity, often with scenarios. Series of sketches showing user task progression. (Example: UMOJA app storyboards)
        -   **Generating Storyboards:** From scenario, break into steps focusing on interaction, one scene per step
    -   **Card-Based Prototypes:** Using index cards to capture/explore interaction elements. (Example: Travel organizer card prototype; Volunteer orientation card prototype)
    -   **Design Maps (Customer Journey/Experience Maps):** Card-based prototypes for end-to-end scenario exploration with personas. Illustrates user's path through product/service.
        -   Representations: Wheel (interaction phase focus), Timeline (service with start/end). (Examples: "Flight to NYC" wheel map; "Megan delivers presentation" timeline map)
        -   **Generating Card-Based Prototypes:** From storyboards or use cases
    -   **Wizard of Oz:** Software-based prototype where human operator simulates software response to user interaction.
        -   Applications: Gestural behavior, child-virtual agent dialogues, human-robot interaction. (Example setup for pen correction WoZ)
11. **High-Fidelity Prototyping:**
    -   Closest resemblance to final design (details, functionality)
    -   E.g., software prototype in Python vs. paper mock-up
    -   Covers UI and UX aspects
    -   Developed by modifying/integrating existing components (developer kits, open-source)
12. **Low-Fidelity vs. High-Fidelity Prototyping**
    *(Table is mentioned here: Advantages and Disadvantages of each)*
13. **Different Development Philosophies:**
    -   **Evolutionary Prototyping:** Prototype evolves into final product; built with engineering principles, rigorous testing at each stage
    -   **Throwaway Prototyping:** Prototypes are stepping stones, thrown away; final product built from scratch; less rigorous testing needed for prototypes
14. **Tools Available for Prototyping:**
    -   Importance of right tool for quality prototype
    -   Range from basic user flow demo to full-stack (design, simulate interactions, collaborate, generate code)
    -   Examples: Adobe XD, InVision, Sketch, Figma

## 7.2 Conceptual to Concrete Design

### 7.2.1 Conceptual Design
-   Outline of what people can do with a product and concepts needed to understand interaction
-   Emerges from understanding problem space and functional requirements
-   **Depends on:** who user is, interaction kind, interface kind, terminology, metaphors, application domain
-   **First step:** Empathize with users (contextual interviews, wall walking through affinity diagrams)
-   Testing ideas, team discussion, prototyping for user testing
-   Creativity/brainstorming to build picture of users/goals
-   Gradual emergence of concrete user experience
-   Ready-made components ease idea prototyping and conceptual model exploration
-   **Developing an Initial Conceptual Model - Core Components:**
    -   Metaphors and analogies
    -   Concepts exposed to users
    -   Relationship between concepts
    -   Mappings between concepts and user experience supported
-   **Interface Metaphors:** Combine familiar and new knowledge to aid understanding.
    -   Example: Educational system for 6-year-olds - classroom vs. engaging metaphor (ball game, circus)
    -   **Evaluating Metaphors:** Structure provided, relevance, ease of representation, audience understanding, extensibility
-   **Interaction Types:** After metaphor identification/evaluation
    -   Instructing, conversing, manipulating, exploring, responding
    -   Choice depends on application domain and product type (e.g., game - manipulating; drawing app - instructing/conversing)
-   **Initial conceptual models captured in Wireframes:** Documents showing structure, content, controls; varying abstraction levels

### 7.2.2 Concrete Design
-   Specifies design details (layout, navigation) while conceptual design outlines what users can do/concepts
-   Closely related to conceptual design; issues highlighted iteratively
-   Balance environmental, user, data, usability, UX requirements with functional requirements
-   **Concrete Design Considerations:**
    -   Visual appearance
    -   Interface types with associated guidelines/principles
    -   User characteristics and context
    -   Accessibility (extent product is accessible to many) and Inclusiveness (fair, open, equal)
    -   Designing for different cultures (Cross-cultural design: appropriate language, colors, icons, navigation, info architecture)

## 7.3 Involving Users in Design
1.  **Participatory Design:** All stakeholders (employees, customers, end-users, partners, designers, researchers) actively involved. Users as full participants, understanding their POV. Mutual learning between users and designers.
2.  **Design Thinking:** Modern approach to involve users.
    -   Used to understand users, challenge assumptions, redefine problems, create innovative solutions for prototyping/testing
    -   Tackles ill-defined/unknown (wicked) problems by reframing in human-centric ways
    -   **Five Stages of Design Thinking (non-linear, iterative):**
        -   Stage 1: Empathize - Research Users' Needs
        -   Stage 2: Define - State Users' Needs and Problems
        -   Stage 3: Ideate - Challenge Assumptions and Create Ideas
        -   Stage 4: Prototype - Start to Create Solutions
        -   Stage 5: Test - Try Your Solutions Out
3.  **Summary points:** Low/high fidelity prototyping, conceptual/concrete design, interface metaphors, interaction styles, scenarios/prototypes in design, user involvement through participatory design/design thinking

# Chapter 8: Evaluating Designs
*(Based on Teachers note_Section 08.pdf)*

## 8.1 Introduction to Design Evaluation
1.  **Goal:** Importance, what, where, and when of evaluation in product lifecycle
2.  **Last phase of Double Diamond**
3.  **Integral to design process:** collecting/analyzing data about user experiences with an artifact to improve its design
4.  **Focuses on usability and user experience**
5.  **Many evaluation methods; depends on goals**
6.  **Often involves observing participants;** some methods don't involve users (modeling, analytics)
7.  **Control levels:** In the wild vs. Lab environment
8.  **Why Evaluate?**
    -   User experience involves all aspects of interaction
    -   Users expect more than just usability
    -   Well-designed products sell well; improved customer journeys increase satisfaction, lift revenue, lower service costs (McKinsey)
9.  **What to Evaluate?** Ranges from low-tech prototypes to complete systems. Different evaluations for different product types.
10. **Where to Evaluate?**
    -   Lab environment: For characteristics like web accessibility
    -   Natural setting (in-the-wild): For user experience aspects
    -   Remote studies: For online behavior (social networking)
11. **When to Evaluate?**
    -   Depends on product type and development process
    -   New products: Market research, user requirements, then prototype evaluation
    -   **Formative Evaluations:** During design to check product meets user needs
    -   **Summative Evaluations:** Assess success of a finished product

## 8.2 Usability Testing
1.  **Traditionally in controlled lab settings**
2.  **Emphasizes product usability**
3.  **Allows control over user actions, environment, social influences**
4.  **Tests if product is usable by intended users for designed tasks and if users are satisfied**

## 8.3 Types of Evaluation (based on setting, user involvement, control)
1.  **Controlled settings directly involving users:** User activities controlled to test hypotheses, measure/observe behaviors. Main methods: usability testing, experiments.
2.  **Natural settings involving users:** Little/no control of user activities to see real-world use. Main method: field studies.
3.  **Any settings not directly involving users:** Consultants/researchers critique, predict, model interface aspects for obvious usability problems. Methods: inspections, heuristics, walk-throughs, models, analytics.

## 8.4 Evaluating in Controlled Settings
1.  **Experiments and user tests control user actions**
2.  **Collecting data using combined methods in controlled setting**
3.  **Determine if interface is usable by intended population for designed tasks**

## 8.5 Evaluating in Natural Settings
1.  **Evaluate products with users in their natural settings**
2.  **Data:** events, conversations (notes, audio/video), participant diaries/notes
3.  **Goal:** Be unobtrusive, not affect behavior
4.  **Crowdsourcing:** Accessing large numbers of participants online for tasks/feedback

## 8.6 Evaluating without Users
1.  **Researcher imagines or models likely interface use**
2.  **Data via:** codified knowledge in heuristics, remotely collected data, predictive models
3.  **Popular methods:** Heuristic evaluation, walkthroughs, analytics, A/B testing, predictive modeling

### 8.6.1 Heuristic Evaluation
-   Guided by usability principles (heuristics) to evaluate UI elements (dialogs, menus, navigation, help) against principles
-   Heuristics resemble high-level design principles
-   **Jakob Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics:**
    -   Visibility of System Status
    -   Match Between System and Real World
    -   User Control and Freedom
    -   Consistency and Standards
    -   Error Prevention
    -   Recognition Rather Than Recall
    -   Flexibility and Efficiency of Use
    -   Aesthetic and Minimalist Design
    -   Help Users Recognize/Diagnose/Recover from Errors
    -   Help and Documentation

### 8.6.2 Walk-Throughs
-   Alternative to heuristic evaluation for predicting user problems without user testing
-   Involves walking through a task with the product, noting problematic usability features
-   Most methods don't involve users
-   **Cognitive Walk-Throughs:**
    -   Simulating user problem-solving at each interaction step
    -   Cognitive perspective: focus on evaluating designs for ease of learning (users learn by exploration)
    -   Example: ATM tasks (withdraw cash, check balance, deposit check)
    -   Four questions to ask at each step:
        1.  Will user try right outcome?
        2.  Notice correct action?
        3.  Associate action with outcome?
        4.  See progress if correct action performed?
-   **Pluralistic Walk-Throughs:**
    -   Users, developers, usability researchers work together through a task scenario
    -   Discuss usability issues with dialog elements
    -   Each person assumes role of typical user
    -   Individuals write down action sequences for prototype screens without conferring
    -   Benefits: Strong focus on user tasks at detailed level

### 8.6.3 Analytics and A/B Testing
-   Software records user actions (keystrokes, mouse movements, time on page/help, task flow)
-   **Web Analytics:** Interaction logging for analyzing user activity on websites. Helps notice user loss not obvious from small numbers. (Example: Google Analytics dashboard showing users, sessions, page views, device breakdown etc.)
-   **A/B Testing:**
    -   Evaluates website/app by comparing two designs (control vs. experimental) with two user groups
    -   Large-scale controlled experiment, often with thousands of participants
    -   Example: Microsoft Office 2007 home page redesign. New design ("Buy now" with price) decreased downloads by 64% compared to old ("Try for free" and "Buy now").
