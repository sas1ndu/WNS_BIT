# Chapter 1: Introduction to Interaction Design and User Experience

-   **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI):** A discipline concerned with the design, evaluation, and implementation of interactive computing systems for human use and the study of major phenomena surrounding them.
-   **History of HCI:** Evolved from an era where only IT professionals used computers to the current state of personal computing accessible to non-technical users.
-   **Goals of HCI:** To create usable software-enabled products, enhance existing product usability, and identify real-world problems solvable with software.
-   **HCI as Interdisciplinary:** Combines computer science, engineering, psychology, social sciences, and design.
-   **Modern HCI Paradigms:** Includes Human Factors (optimizing man-machine fit), Classical Cognitivism (optimizing information transfer), and Phenomenologically Situated (supporting real-world actions).
-   **Evolution of Interfaces:** Progressed from hardware-level switches to pervasive interfaces like mobile devices and embedded technology.
-   **Importance of Good Design:** Poor interfaces can lead to disasters or significant issues, as seen in examples like the Three Mile Island incident or confusing car shifters.
-   **User Experience (UX) Definition:** Encompasses all aspects of an end-user's interaction with a company, its services, and its products, focusing on understanding user needs, values, and limitations.
-   **UI vs. UX:** UI (User Interface) is the visual and interactive elements a user engages with, while UX is the overall internal experience; UI is a subset of UX.
-   **Why, What, How of UX Design:** A framework where "Why" addresses user motivations and needs, "What" defines product functionality, and "How" deals with the interaction aesthetics and accessibility.
-   **User-Centered Design (UCD) Process:** An iterative design philosophy that prioritizes understanding user context and requirements at every stage: understand context, specify requirements, design solutions, evaluate.
-   **Design Principles:** Fundamental guidelines for creating good user experiences, such as Visibility, Feedback, Constraints, Consistency, and Affordance.
-   **Understanding Users:** Involves considering diverse factors like privacy, education level, business needs, gender, age, and cultural differences to design effective products.
-   **Accessibility:** Designing products to be usable by people with various disabilities (visual, auditory, motor, cognitive).
-   **Multi-Cultural Interaction:** Designing interfaces that are sensitive and adaptable to different cultural norms, languages, formats (date, currency), symbols, and aesthetics.

# Chapter 2: Conceptual Interaction

-   **Interaction Design (IxD) Definition & Goal:** A component of UX design focusing on the interaction between users and products, aiming to create products that enable users to achieve their objectives effectively.
-   **Double Diamond Framework:** A design process model consisting of four phases: Discover (insight into the problem), Define (area to focus upon), Develop (potential solutions), and Deliver (solutions that work).
-   **Importance of User Involvement:** Ensures usability, manages user expectations, provides training, and fosters a sense of ownership.
-   **Understanding the Problem Space:** Critically analyzing the existing situation, user needs, and context before designing solutions to avoid misunderstandings and poor design.
-   **Proof of Concepts:** Early-stage implementations or models to check the feasibility of an idea and articulate its basic building blocks.

-   **Conceptual Models Definition:** High-level descriptions of how a system is organized and operates, helping designers clarify their thinking before detailed UI design.
-   **Xerox Star (Classic Conceptual Model):** An early office system based on a conceptual model familiar to users, using the "desktop metaphor" with digital documents and folders behaving like their physical counterparts.
-   **Interface Metaphors:** Using familiar concepts or objects (e.g., the desktop, a book, filing cabinets) to help users understand and interact with new, unfamiliar digital systems.
-   **Interaction Types (Overview):** Different ways a user interacts with a product, including instructing, conversing, manipulating, exploring, and responding.
-   **Instructing (Interaction Type):** Users issue commands to a system through typing, selecting options from menus, voice commands, or touch gestures.

-   **Perception (Cognitive Process):** How information is acquired from the environment through the senses and transformed into experiences.
-   **Memory (Cognitive Process):** Recalling knowledge to act appropriately; humans are generally better at recognizing information than recalling it from scratch.
-   **Mental Models (User's understanding):** Internal representations people create to understand and predict how systems work, often incomplete or inaccurate.
-   **Gulfs of Execution and Evaluation:** The gaps between a user's intentions and the system's actions (gulf of execution), and between the system's state and the user's understanding of it (gulf of evaluation).
-   **Information Processing Model:** A cognitive framework that conceptualizes the mind as processing information through a series of ordered stages (e.g., input, encoding, comparison, response).
-   **Distributed Cognition:** A framework that views cognitive processes as distributed across individuals, artifacts, and the environment, rather than solely within an individual's mind.
-   **External Cognition:** Focuses on how we use external representations (like notes or diagrams) to reduce memory load, offload computation, or trace cognitive steps.
-   **Embodied Interaction:** Considers interaction with technology as a physical experience, often involving wearables, haptic feedback, or tangible interfaces.
-   **Social Interactions (Co-presence):** How technology can support interactions between people who are in the same physical space, facilitating collaboration.
